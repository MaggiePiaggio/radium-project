                            <p>
                                Looking for the Top  TV Shows on Netflix now? Well, you're in the right place! Despite the streaming service launching the trending list earlier this year, which reveals what the Top 10 most popular TV shows are on a daily basis, it's not super easy to find that list on Netflix itself without digging into it a little bit. We're here to help streamline that process.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This week continued what seems likely to be the ongoing dominant presence of Korean horror-thriller-sci-fi series Squid Game, followed by the newest season of British drama Sex Education. Meanwhile, still present are thriller series Clickbait, the final season of Lucifer, and the new season of The Circle.
